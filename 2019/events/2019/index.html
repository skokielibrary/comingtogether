          <p class="event-meta">3:00 PM, Skokie Public Library</p>
          <p>Enjoy a jazz performance primarily featuring the music of Frederick Chopin with singer Grazyna Auguscik and pianist Ben Lewis.</p>

<p>Singer, composer, arranger, and producer Grazyna Auguscik is one of the most intriguing contemporary vocalists on today’s world jazz scene. Her elusive style challenges traditional definitions of jazz and shows a vocalist and musician without boundaries. Her unorthodox approach to rewriting classic works pays tribute to their authors and at the same time is an adventure into uncharted territory. Pianist Ben Lewis has collaborated with many artists and made two tours abroad as a jazz ambassador for the U.S. State Department in 11 countries throughout West Africa and East Asia.</p>

          <p>Please join us for an afternoon of Polish folk stories. Each region in Poland brings something different and unique. Just like it’s landscape from meadows through rivers and mountains, the legends of Poland are sweet, scary or simply entertaining. From the tale about “Dragon in Vavel”, “Torun’s Gingerbread” to “Interrupted sound of Krakowski’s trumpet-call”, the audience will travel not only through small, picturesque villages but also through time. We will see some folk art as well as traditional cut outs in paper.Agnieszka Rynkiewicz-Sarrafian is a story teller, fairy tale writer, poet and translator. Sponsored by the Lincolnwood Multi-Cultural Task Force.</p>
