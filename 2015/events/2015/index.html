          <p>In 1977, Skokie was shaken to its core when a small group of neo-Nazis tried to march there. This attracted national and international attention, leading to landmark legal cases.It set the stage for a clear-cut conflict between the organization’s First Amendment rights and Skokie residents’ right to live free of intimidation. The film made extensive use of archival footage and contemporary interviews to reveal how a debate over First Amendment rights inspired Holocaust survivors to create the Illinois Holocaust Museum &amp; Education Center. Film will be followed by discussion led by Buzz Alpert.</p>
