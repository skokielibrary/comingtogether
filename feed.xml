        <title>International Night Celebration</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You are invited to a special night of free entertainment! International Night is taking place on Saturday, April 18. This biyearly tradition is an opportunity to find unity in what seems like a divided world. Our students remind us that we are a special community made up of cultural traditions and richness of identities. Let’s be proud this year more than ever to showcase what makes this school such an incredible place to work and play. Come out and enjoy an evening of cultural food, traditional dancing and performances from various student cultural clubs. All are welcome to attend–bring your family and friends for a night of fun! Food will be sold for an additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Human Library</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Check out a ‘human book’ and have a conversation with your ‘books’ to learn about their journey to Niles and Maine Townships. We hope to have a wide variety of ‘books’ to check out. The Human Library concept was designed to create an atmosphere where an honest conversation can be had in a safe environment. Learn from our community members about their journeys, their triumphs, and their challenges. Stop by the libraries at each campus to check out your ‘book.’ This program is a collaboration between Oakton Community College Library and Oakton’s Office of Student Life and Campus Inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
