After being forced to give up her fruit-vending cart, Juana secures a position as a kitchen assistant at a local Japanese restaurant. At work, she secretly observes the sushi chefs and eventually teaches herself to make a multitude of sushi. But gender and ethnicity turn into an obstacle to her dreams of becoming a sushi chef.
