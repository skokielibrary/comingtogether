Join Oakton Emeritus faculty Beverly Friend as she tells her personal story of how a friendship between her late husband Jim and Professor Xu Xin of Nanjing University who was teaching a course in American Jewish authors, but had never actually met anyone Jewish, led to an explosion of Judaic studies in China.

This event will be held in Room A145.
