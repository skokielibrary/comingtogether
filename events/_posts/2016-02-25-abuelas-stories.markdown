There is a proverb that says "You do not really understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother" and I would add "there is nothing you can understand until your grandma tells you a story!" The stories of our Abuela's rejoice us, and bring us back to our childhood years. We remember their love and understanding of our crazy teenage adventures, and in adulthood, we knew they would always have the right answers for those hard life questions.
