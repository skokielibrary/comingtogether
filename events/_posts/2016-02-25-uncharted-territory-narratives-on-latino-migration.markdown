Join us for this lively discussion challenging the usual narratives of Latina/o migration. Chicago resident and writer José Ángel N., author of the book Illegal: Reflections of an Undocumented Immigrant, will talk about the migration experience as an undocumented individual. Scholars Amalia Pallares and Joel Huerta will contextualize the movement of Latina/os as they’ve moved north, while local activists Julián Lazalde and Juliet de Jesus Alejandre will provide further insight into what the Latina/o community is doing to advocate for its well-being.
