Join us for a bilingual book discussion of Cristina Henríquez’s novel The Book of Unknown Americans/El Libro de los Americanos Desconocidos at the ELL Parent Center. A dilapidated apartment building in Delaware is the final destination for its Spanish speaking, immigrant neighbors. The Rivera Family, newly arrived from Mexico, has suffered recent tragedy that has left their daughter Alma with a traumatic brain injury but that doesn’t keep her from being noticed by one of the young boys in the building. At turns heart wrenching and hopeful, Henríquez’s novel is a beautiful and compassionate coming-of-age story. Register and pick up a book in English or Spanish at the ELL Parent Center, located at 9440 Kenton Ave. in Skokie.
