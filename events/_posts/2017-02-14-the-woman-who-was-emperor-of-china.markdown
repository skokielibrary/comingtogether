Wu Zetian (also known as Wu Zhao) was the only female Emperor in Chinese history. She reigned from 690-705 AD in the Tang dynasty, ascending to the throne after her husband died, and their sons proved unsatisfactory replacements. Wu Zetian, an extraordinary politician, was able to handle the court factions, and oversee the expanding imperial borders. Although there were many powerful court ladies before and after Wu Zetianâ€™s time, no other woman was ever recognized as Emperor of the imperial realm. Refreshments will be served. Appropriate for adults, high school students.
