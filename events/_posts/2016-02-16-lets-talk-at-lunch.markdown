Join us for our new monthly series in partnership with the YWCA Evanston. This month’s topic is “Latin American Migration and Assumptions.” Our goal is to learn how to talk through issues of racism and equity instead of around them. Here’s how it works: you bring your lunch and we provide a facilitator and topic to discuss.

This program is made possible by a grant from the Skokie Community Fund.
