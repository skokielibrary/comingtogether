In this presentation Dominican/Puerto Rican Visual Artist, Sonia Báez Hernández, employs the multiplicities of identities to account for her artistic expression. “I contextualize my visual art and performance arts at the edge of the gathering of memories marked by cultural differences, heterogeneous histories, displacements, movements of territories and deterritorialization, radicalized/ethnic corporality and foreign accents... Immigrants and those who claim multiple identities are always situated in relation to the outside, in localized situations, in heterogeneity, transformation, social formation, and rapture. The multiplicities of identities open up the possibilities to enunciate possible communities, new consciousness, and forms of contestation, political solidarity, and artistic expressions”. Sponsored by the Latina and Latino Studies Program and the INSTITUTE for the Humanities, Northwestern University.
