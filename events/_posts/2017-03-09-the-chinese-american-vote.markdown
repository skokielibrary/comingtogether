There’s an oft-repeated myth that Asian Americans aren’t interested in voting. Learn how three community organizers worked to defy that myth and galvanize the Chinese American vote, using the recent election of Illinois State Representative Theresa Mah (IL-2) as an example of community members working together to test establishment politics. Registration required at skokielibrary.info/events.
