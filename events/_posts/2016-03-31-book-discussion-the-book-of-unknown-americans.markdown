Join us for a discussion of The Book of Unknown Americans by Cristina Henríquez. A dilapidated apartment building in Delaware is the final destination for its Spanish speaking, immigrant neighbors. The Rivera Family, newly arrived from Mexico, suffered recent tragedy that has left their daughter Alma with a traumatic brain injury but that doesn’t keep her from being noticed by one of the young boys in the building. At turns heart wrenching and hopeful, Henríquez’s novel is a beautiful and compassionate coming-of-age story.
