Join us for our new monthly discussion series in partnership with the YWCA Evanston. This month’s topic is “Immigrant, Refugee, Migrant, Citizen: Who Is Welcome?” Our goal is to learn how to talk through issues of racism and equity instead of around them. Here’s how it works: you bring your lunch and we provide a facilitator and topic to discuss.

This program is made possible by a grant from the Skokie Community Fund.
