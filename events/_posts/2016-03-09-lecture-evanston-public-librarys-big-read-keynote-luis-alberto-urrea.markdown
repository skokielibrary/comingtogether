"Into the Beautiful North" author, Luis Alberto Urrea, will present his lecture "Universal Border: From Tijuana to the World." Mr. Urrea will share his story of transformation from his beginnings on a dirt street in Tijuana to Pulitzer Prize finalist and beloved storyteller. Though recognized as a writer who concentrates on the border regions of the Southwestern United States, Urrea says, “Borders don’t interest me. I’m really in the business of building bridges.”  The author will be available to sign copies of the book following the lecture.
