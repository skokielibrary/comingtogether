What does it mean to be Chinese in the United States? How does the idea of ‘Chinese-ness’ mobilize Chinese Americans into a distinct voting bloc? Justin Tse, Professor of Asian American Studies at Northwestern University, explores how Chinese Americans have been the convenient “other,” and how Chinese Americans subvert these narratives, organize for greater visibility, and ultimately gain political prominence in America.
