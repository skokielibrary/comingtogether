Alfonso “Piloto” Nieves Ruiz is a self-taught artist from Queretaro, Mexico who’s sculptural pieces will be on display at the Library as part of this year’s Viva! series. Piloto will guide people through the exhibit which explores themes of migration and borders and features recent political events in Mexico all while using recycled materials. The talk will be followed by a reception.
