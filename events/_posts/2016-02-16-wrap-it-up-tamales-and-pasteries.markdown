The art of wrapped foods dates back to the beginning of civilization. Indigenous practices influence the way we prepare and eat food today, such as wrapping dishes in leave and other organic materials. Join Jorgé Félix and Mac Mendoza as they have a comparative conversation and demonstration, teaching the traditions of Central American tamales and Caribbean pasteles. Tastings will follow the conversation. Registration is required.
