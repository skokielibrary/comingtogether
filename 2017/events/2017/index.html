The Book Stall will be on hand selling copies of his books and a signing will follow the presentation. <em>Space is limited, so individual registration is required and opens February 12th</em>. Registration will be available through the following link or at any participating library.</p>

          <p class="event-meta">7:00 pm, Holiday Inn Chicago North Shore</p>
          <p>Join us for an evening with Gene Luen Yang, author of both <em>American Born Chinese</em> and <em>Shadow Hero</em>. Yang is the first writer who works primarily in graphic novels to be appointed by the Library of Congress as the National Ambassador for Young People’s Literature. The MacArthur Foundation named him a fellow in 2016 noting that his work “demonstrates the potential of comics to broaden our understanding of diverse cultures and people.” A highly acclaimed presenter, Yang will discuss his books and the importance of reading without walls. The Book Stall will be on hand selling copies of his books and a signing will follow the presentation. <em>Space is limited, so individual registration is required and opens February 12th</em>. Registration will be available through the following link or at any participating library.</p>

<p>Doors open at 6:15 p.m.</p>
